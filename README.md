# GlucoTrack-AI
GlucoTrack AI is a predictive analytics system designed to help individuals with diabetes or prediabetes manage their blood sugar levels without constant finger-pricking. Instead of relying on continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), the system uses user-provided lifestyle dataâ€”such as meals, physical activity, sleep.
