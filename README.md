# 🍬 GlucoTrack-AI

**GlucoTrack-AI** is a predictive analytics system designed to help individuals with diabetes or prediabetes manage their blood sugar levels without constant finger-pricking. Instead of relying on continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), the system uses user-provided lifestyle data—such as meals, physical activity, and sleep—to predict blood sugar trends and provide personalized recommendations.

By leveraging AI and machine learning, GlucoTrack-AI empowers users to make informed decisions about their health and improve long-term management of diabetes through data-driven insights.
